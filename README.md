# 🃏 TriPeaks Card Game - Data Structures Project

Welcome to the **TriPeaks Card Game** repository! This project was developed as part of a **Data Structures and Algorithms** course, showcasing the application of advanced data structures and algorithms in building an interactive and engaging card game using C#.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Graph-Based Card Management**  
  Utilizes directed graphs to dynamically manage card relationships and game logic.

- **Custom Controls**  
  Includes custom-designed UI elements such as:
  - Rounded panels
  - Card piles
  - Individual playing cards

- **Shuffling Algorithm**  
  Implements an efficient card shuffling mechanism using jagged arrays for optimal performance.

- **Game Mechanics**  
  Features include:
  - Card movement
  - Hint system
  - Undo functionality
  - Automated score tracking

- **High Score Management**  
  Persistent high score storage and sorting using efficient algorithms.

## 📊 Game Mechanics Overview

### Card Management
- Directed graphs represent card relationships.
- Cards are removed from the graph as they are played, ensuring dynamic interaction.

### Scoring and Persistence
- High scores are stored persistently.
- Uses efficient sorting algorithms for real-time leaderboard updates.

### Undo and Hint System
- A stack-based undo mechanism allows players to revert moves.
- The hint system evaluates possible moves and highlights them for the player.
