TriPeaks Card Game - Data Structures Project

This repository contains the implementation of the "TriPeaks" card game, developed as a project for a Data Structures and Algorithms course. The project demonstrates the application of advanced data structures and algorithmic concepts in building an interactive card game using C#.

Key Features:

Graph-Based Card Management: Implements card relationships using directed graphs to handle game logic dynamically.

Custom Controls: Includes custom-designed UI elements such as rounded panels, card piles, and individual playing cards for a seamless gaming experience.

Shuffling Algorithm: Efficient card shuffling mechanism using jagged arrays for optimal performance.

Game Mechanics: Features include card movement, hint system, undo functionality, and automated score tracking.

High Score Management: Stores and sorts high scores using efficient algorithms for persistent ranking.

Technologies Used:

Language: C#

IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio

Data Structures: Arrays, Graphs, Lists, Stacks

This project showcases how fundamental data structure concepts can be applied in a practical and engaging way, combining algorithmic design with software development skills.
